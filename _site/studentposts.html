This documentary is unlike other political documentaries because there is no narrator or use of previously filmed footage. All of the footage and interactions in the film are […]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=athenasowl1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45489166&#038;post=135&#038;subd=athenasowl1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" /></li>
